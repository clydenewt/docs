Indexers facilitate efficient data retrieval within blockchain systems by creating structured indexes. In the context of blockchain and dApps, indexers extract on-chain data into optimized database structures for efficient querying of transaction histories, smart contract states, event logs, and more.

## Why Use Indexers?

Querying data directly from a blockchain node can be:

1. **Slow**: On-chain queries are limited in complexity
2. **Resource-intensive**: Full node queries can be expensive and inefficient
3. **Limited**: Many query patterns are impossible on-chain
4. **Unreliable**: Direct node queries can time out or fail under load

Indexers address these issues by:

- Providing optimized databases for fast, complex queries
- Supporting real-time data feeds for applications
- Enabling complex analytics that would be impossible on-chain
- Reducing load on blockchain nodes
- Supporting historical data analysis

## Types of Indexer Solutions

Several indexer solutions are available for Neutron, each offering different levels of:

- Decentralization
- Ease of development
- Performance
- Customizability
- Query capabilities

## Use Cases for Indexers

Indexers enable a wide range of applications and services:

- **Block Explorers**: Providing detailed information about transactions, blocks, and accounts
- **DeFi Dashboards**: Tracking token prices, liquidity pools, and user positions
- **Analytics Platforms**: Analyzing trends, user behavior, and protocol metrics
- **Wallet Applications**: Showing transaction history and token balances
- **dApp Backends**: Powering user interfaces with fast data access
- **Trading Bots**: Monitoring real-time data for trading opportunities

## Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you work effectively with indexers:

### Data Sources

Indexers typically connect to blockchain nodes via RPC endpoints to retrieve data. They may also use event subscriptions or other methods to get real-time updates.

### Data Processing

Raw blockchain data must be transformed, normalized, and enriched before being stored in the index.

### Data Storage

Indexed data is stored in optimized databases designed for fast queries and analytics.

### Query Interface

Most indexers provide APIs (often GraphQL or REST) for querying the indexed data.

<Note>
  When choosing an indexer solution, consider your specific requirements for data freshness, query complexity, and the level of decentralization needed for your application.
