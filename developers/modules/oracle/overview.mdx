# Oracle Module

The Oracle module provides reliable, high-frequency price data for a wide range of assets, enabling DeFi applications to operate with accurate and timely market information.

## Overview

Price oracles are a critical component of DeFi infrastructure, serving as the connection between blockchain smart contracts and external market data. The Neutron Oracle module:

- Delivers price data with per-block updates
- Provides robust security through multiple data sources
- Enables governance-controlled price feed management
- Integrates directly with smart contracts for seamless access

## Key Features

### High-Frequency Price Updates

- **Per-Block Updates**: Price data is updated every block
- **Low Latency**: Minimized delay between market price changes and on-chain availability
- **Consistent Delivery**: Reliable delivery even during high volatility

### Multiple Data Sources

- **Aggregated Feeds**: Price data aggregated from multiple sources
- **Weighted Averaging**: Advanced weighting algorithms for optimal accuracy
- **Outlier Rejection**: Automatic filtering of anomalous data points

### Extensive Asset Coverage

- **Major Cryptocurrencies**: BTC, ETH, ATOM, and more
- **Stablecoins**: USDC, USDT, DAI, and others
- **Protocol Tokens**: NTRN and other ecosystem tokens
- **Fiat Currencies**: USD, EUR, and other major currencies

### Smart Contract Integration

- **Simple Query Interface**: Easy-to-use query methods for contracts
- **Multiple Price Types**: Spot prices, TWAPs, and other statistical measures
- **Historical Data**: Access to recent historical prices for trend analysis

## Architecture

The Oracle module operates through a multi-layered architecture:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: External relayers gather price data from exchanges and other sources
2. **Aggregation Layer**: On-chain logic validates and combines multiple data points
3. **Storage Layer**: Efficient state management optimized for frequent updates
4. **Access Layer**: Query interfaces for smart contracts and other modules

## Use Cases

### Lending Protocols

- Accurate collateral valuation
- Precise liquidation thresholds
- Dynamic interest rate determination

### Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

- Reduced impermanent loss through price-aware LP mechanisms
- Enhanced arbitrage protection
- Improved price discovery

### Derivatives Protocols

- Settlement price determination
- Mark price calculation
- Funding rate updates

### Portfolio Management

- Real-time portfolio valuation
- Dynamic rebalancing triggers
- Performance tracking
