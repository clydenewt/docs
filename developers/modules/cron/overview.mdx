# Cron Module

The Cron module allows developers to schedule automatic smart contract executions at predefined times or intervals, similar to Unix cron jobs.

## Overview

In decentralized applications, scheduled operations are essential for many use cases but traditionally difficult to implement securely. The Cron module solves this by providing:

- Precise timing controls for smart contract execution
- Blockchain-enforced scheduling reliability
- Gas-efficient execution of periodic tasks

## Key Features

### Time-Based Scheduling

Schedule contract executions based on:
- Block height (every N blocks)
- Block time (specific timestamps)
- Custom iterators for complex scheduling patterns

### Secure Execution Context

- Calls are executed within the secure context of the Neutron blockchain
- Guaranteed execution order with proper error handling
- Resource limits to prevent system abuse

### Multi-Contract Workflow Support

- Chain multiple contract calls in a scheduled operation
- Set dependencies between scheduled operations
- Handle successful/failed execution paths

## Ideal Use Cases

The Cron module is particularly useful for:

- **Periodic Protocol Operations**: Rebalancing pools, calculating rewards
- **Time-Sensitive Events**: Auction endings, governance execution
- **Maintenance Tasks**: State cleanup, metric calculations
- **Scheduled Fund Transfers**: Vesting releases, scheduled payments
- **Interest and Yield Distribution**: Regular disbursement of earnings

## Architecture

The module maintains a schedule of tasks to be executed, with each task containing:
- Execution time information
- Contract address to call
- Message to send to the contract
- Optional dependencies and follow-up actions

When a block is produced, the module scans for tasks due for execution and performs the specified calls.

## Gas Model

The Cron module uses a pre-paid gas model:
- Task creators must pre-fund tasks with sufficient gas
- Unused gas can be reclaimed when tasks are completed or canceled
- Gas limits ensure system stability

## Getting Started

To start using the Cron module in your smart contracts:

1. Review the [How-to Guide](/developers/modules/cron/how-to) for practical examples
2. Check the [Reference Documentation](/developers/modules/cron/reference) for API details
3. Explore example contracts in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/tree/main/contracts/croncat)
