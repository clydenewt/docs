Supervaults are Neutron's headline DeFi innovation that manage liquidity on behalf of users across multiple venues. Using Neutron's integrated infrastructure, they dynamically adjust to market conditions in real-time, achieving maximal capital efficiency and improving outcomes for both traders and liquidity providers.

Unlike traditional yield vaults or static liquidity pools, Supervaults actively optimize capital deployment to:

- Minimize slippage for traders
- Maximize fees earned by liquidity providers
- Reduce impermanent loss through dynamic position management

  <Card title="For Liquidity Providers" icon="coins" iconType="duotone">
    Supervaults offer enhanced returns through strategic liquidity placement, fee optimization, and potential reduction of impermanent loss.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="For Traders" icon="chart-line" iconType="duotone">
    Supervaults provide deeper liquidity at current price points, resulting in significantly reduced slippage for large trades and better execution quality.

## How Supervaults Work

Supervaults are integrated with Neutron's core modules to enable continuous, trustless operation:

### Dynamic Positioning with Oracle and Cron

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Oracle Integration" icon="globe" iconType="duotone">
    Supervaults leverage Neutron's high-frequency oracle to receive accurate price data every block, enabling precise liquidity positioning.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Automated Rebalancing" icon="clock" iconType="duotone">
    The Cron module triggers rebalancing operations when needed, allowing vaults to reposition liquidity as market conditions change without requiring off-chain bots.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Capital Deployment" icon="money-bill-transfer" iconType="duotone">
    Liquidity is concentrated around current market prices, maximizing efficiency and ensuring capital is always productively deployed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Technical Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Deposits] --> B[Supervault Contract]
    D[Oracle Module] -- Provides Price --> B
    B -- Issues --> C[Vault Share Tokens]
    B -- Places Liquidity --> E[Duality DEX]
    F[Cron Module] -- Triggers --> G[Rebalance Function]
    G --> B
    E -- Generates --> H[Trading Fees]
    H --> B
    B -- Compounds --> B
```


When a user deposits assets into a Supervault:

1. The vault issues share tokens representing their proportional ownership
2. The contract reads the current price from Neutron's Oracle
3. Liquidity is strategically deployed into Duality DEX around the current price
4. As prices move, Cron triggers rebalancing, moving liquidity to new optimal ranges
5. Trading fees are collected and can be compounded or distributed to shareholders

All of this happens on-chain, with no reliance on external keepers or off-chain infrastructure, ensuring maximum reliability and minimizing operational risk.

## Capital Efficiency Advantages

Supervaults achieve exceptional capital efficiency through several mechanisms:

  <Card title="Concentrated Liquidity" icon="layer-group" iconType="duotone">
    Unlike passive AMMs that spread liquidity across wide price ranges, Supervaults focus capital precisely where it's needed, around current market prices.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Multi-Asset Strategies" icon="chart-pie" iconType="duotone">
    Supervaults can manage complex positions across multiple asset pairs, optimizing for overall portfolio returns rather than individual pairings.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Yield Compounding" icon="arrow-trend-up" iconType="duotone">
    Through automated reinvestment of earned fees, Supervaults maximize the compounding effect for long-term holders.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Multi-Layer Yield" icon="database" iconType="duotone">
    By integrating with other DeFi primitives, Supervaults can layer multiple yield sources on the same capital, such as trading fees, staking rewards, and incentives.
