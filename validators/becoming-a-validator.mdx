This guide will walk you through the process of becoming a Neutron validator after you have [set up and synced your node](/validators/running-a-node).

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, make sure:

- Your node is fully synced with the network
- You have enough NTRN tokens for self-delegation (minimum 1 NTRN)
- You have additional NTRN for transaction fees

## Validator Set Management Policy

Neutron has a formal validator set and delegation management policy established through governance. This policy ensures network performance, security, and decentralization through transparent rotation criteria.

Key aspects to understand before becoming a validator:

- **Active Set Size**: Limited to 20 validators
- **Performance Requirements**: Validators must maintain high performance standards
- **Dual Network Requirement**: Must run both mainnet and testnet nodes
- **Selection Process**: New validators are prioritized by reverse order of mainnet voting power
- **Probationary Period**: New validators undergo a 3-month probation with a small delegation before receiving full delegation

For complete details on the selection process and performance criteria, see the [Validator Incentives](/validators/economics/validator-incentives) documentation.

## Create a Wallet

First, create a wallet for your validator:

```bash
neutrond keys add <wallet-name>
```

Save the mnemonic phrase in a secure location. This wallet will be used for managing your validator.

## Obtain NTRN Tokens

You'll need NTRN tokens to stake as a validator. These can be obtained from:

- Exchanges that list NTRN
- Purchasing ATOM and using IBC transfer to Neutron
- The community (Discord/Telegram) for testnet tokens

## Create Your Validator

Once your node is synced and you have NTRN tokens, you can create your validator:

```bash
neutrond tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=1000000untrn \
  --pubkey=$(neutrond tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="<your-validator-name>" \
  --chain-id=neutron-1 \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-adjustment="1.5" \
  --gas-prices="0.025untrn" \
  --from=<wallet-name>
```

### Command Parameters Explained:

- `amount`: The amount to self-delegate (in untrn)
- `pubkey`: Your validator's public key
- `moniker`: A name for your validator
- `chain-id`: The network ID
- `commission-rate`: Initial commission rate (e.g., 10%)
- `commission-max-rate`: Maximum commission rate (e.g., 20%)
- `commission-max-change-rate`: Maximum daily change in commission rate (e.g., 1%)
- `min-self-delegation`: Minimum self-delegation amount
- `from`: Your wallet name

## Verify Your Validator

After submitting the transaction, verify that your validator is in the active set:

```bash
neutrond query staking validators --limit 1000 -o json | jq '.validators[] | select(.description.moniker=="<your-validator-name>")'
```

You can also check your validator status on Neutron block explorers:

- [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/neutron)
- [Ping.pub](https://ping.pub/neutron)

## Validator Security

Security is critical for a validator. Follow these best practices:

1. **Use a dedicated machine**: Run your validator on a dedicated machine, not shared with other services
2. **Firewall configuration**: Only allow necessary ports (26656, 26657, etc.)
3. **SSH hardening**: Use key-based authentication, disable password login
4. **Sentry nodes**: Set up sentry nodes to protect your validator from DDoS attacks
5. **Hardware security module (HSM)**: Consider using an HSM for key management

## Next Steps

Now that your validator is active, you should:

1. Set up monitoring and alerting
2. Join the validator community
3. Participate in governance
