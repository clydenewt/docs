This document explains the economic model for Neutron validators following the Mercury upgrade.

## Neutron's Unique Compensation Model

Neutron's validator compensation mechanism is designed around a fixed-supply token model with DAO-driven incentives, rather than traditional inflation-based rewards.

### Fixed Supply Model

- **No Inflation**: NTRN remains a fixed-supply asset with no inflation-based block rewards
- **Treasury Allocation**: Validator rewards come from the Neutron DAO Treasury
- **Stable Compensation**: Target compensation is set in USD value, not token count
- **Revenue Module**: Implemented through the new x/revenue module

### Base Compensation

Validators receive a stable monthly compensation from the Neutron DAO Treasury:

- **Target Compensation**: $3,000 USD per month per validator
- **Token Conversion**: Calculated in NTRN tokens based on oracle price
- **Automatic Distribution**: Handled by the x/revenue module
- **Performance Based**: Full rewards require meeting performance thresholds

## Performance Thresholds

Validator compensation is directly tied to performance metrics:

| Performance Level | Block Signing (30D) | Price Updates (30D) | Reward |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Above threshold   | ≥ 99.5%             | ≥ 98%               | Full rewards |
| Medium performance| 95% - 99.5%         | 95% - 98%           | Partial rewards |
| Below threshold   | < 95%               | < 95%               | No rewards |

> **Important**: Validators who fail to meet the minimum performance for any criteria receive no reward for the period, regardless of their performance in other criteria.

## Validator Set and Delegation Management Policy

The Neutron network maintains a formalized policy for validator set management to ensure long-term performance, security, and decentralization. This policy was established through governance proposal [neutron..kx6fytr](https://neutron.celat.one/proposals/32) (April 18).

### Validator Set Rotation Framework

#### Performance-Based Offboarding

A validator is considered for offboarding if any of the following is true:

- **Consecutive Performance**: Received no rewards from x/revenue for two months in a row
  - They are notified the first month, with core teams assisting in troubleshooting
  - The second consecutive month, they are automatically flagged for rotation
  
- **Intermittent Performance**: Received no rewards from x/revenue for three months in a 6 months period
  - They are notified the second month within a 6-month period (unless there are 4 months in-between incidents)
  - The third missed month in a 6-month period, they are automatically flagged for rotation
  
- **Tombstoning**: Validator was tombstoned

#### Downtime-Based Offboarding

A validator is considered for offboarding if any of the following is true:

- **Resumption Latency**: Failed to resume signing within 60 minutes of the first finalized block after a successful upgrade
- **Precommit Latency**: Failed to begin precommitting within 2 hours of the distribution of correct upgrade instructions

In both cases, validators are notified on the first occurrence and marked for rotation on the second.

### Validator Onboarding Process

To join the validator set when a slot opens:

1. **Dual Network Requirement**: Must run both mainnet and testnet nodes
2. **Prioritization**: Eligible operators are prioritized by reverse order of mainnet voting power (e.g., highest voting power first)
3. **Probationary Period**: 
   - Selected operators receive a small delegation from the DAO
   - After demonstrating adequate performance for three months, they receive a full delegation
   - If performance is inadequate during probation, the DAO redelegates to the next operator in line

To maximize chances of receiving DAO delegations, validators should seek to attract NTRN delegations to their validators.

## Delegator Rewards

Unlike traditional Cosmos chains, delegator rewards are handled separately:

- **Target APR**: 3% annual percentage rate
- **DAO Funded**: Rewards come from the Neutron DAO Treasury
- **No Validator Commission**: Validators do not take a commission from delegator rewards
- **Separate System**: Rewards are distributed through a separate mechanism from validator base compensation

## Validator Selection and Delegation

The Neutron DAO actively participates in validator selection:

- **Initial Set**: Carefully selected based on historical performance and quality
- **Maximum Size**: Currently limited to 20 validators
- **DAO Delegations**: The DAO delegates a significant portion of NTRN to validators
- **Prioritization**: New validators are prioritized by reverse order of mainnet voting power

## Governance Participation

While validators focus on infrastructure rather than governance representation:

- **Separate Voting Power**: Delegated stake does not confer governance voting power
- **Optional Participation**: Validators may opt to participate in governance, but it's not required
- **Staked NTRN Voting**: Native stakers can access governance voting power through the Staked NTRN voting vault

## Practical Considerations

### Costs of Running a Validator

- **Infrastructure**: Server costs, bandwidth, and storage
- **Operations**: Monitoring, maintenance, security
- **Redundancy**: Backup systems and failover mechanisms
- **Team**: Technical support and operations staff

### Revenue Sources

- **Base Compensation**: Approximately $3,000 USD per month from the DAO
- **Self-Delegated Rewards**: 3% APR on self-delegated NTRN

## Comparison with Traditional Models

| Aspect | Traditional PoS Model | Neutron's Model |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Reward Source | Inflation | DAO Treasury |
| Reward Mechanism | Proportional to stake | Fixed base compensation + stake rewards |
| Commission | Validators set commission rates | No commission on delegator rewards |
| Slashing | Financial penalties | Jailing and possible removal |
| Delegation Incentive | Higher rewards with trusted validators | Consistent 3% APR regardless of validator |

## Future Evolution

The validator compensation model may evolve through governance:
- **Parameter Adjustments**: Changes to compensation amounts or performance thresholds
- **Additional Criteria**: New performance metrics or requirements
- **Validation Set Size**: Potential changes to the number of active validators
- **Delegation Strategy**: Updates to how the DAO allocates delegations
