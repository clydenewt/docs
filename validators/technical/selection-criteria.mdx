# Validator Selection Criteria

This document outlines the technical, operational, and community criteria for being selected as a Neutron validator.

## Technical Requirements

Technical capability is the foundation of validator selection. Successful validators must demonstrate:

### Hardware Specifications

| Component | Minimum Requirement | Recommended |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| CPU | 4 cores / 8 threads | 8+ cores / 16+ threads |
| RAM | 16 GB | 32 GB+ |
| Storage | 500 GB SSD | 2 TB+ NVMe SSD |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 500+ Mbps |

See our [System Specifications](/validators/technical/system-specs) page for detailed hardware requirements.

### Infrastructure Design

- **Sentry Node Architecture**: Properly configured sentry nodes protecting validator nodes
- **High Availability**: Redundancy in critical systems
- **Disaster Recovery**: Documented recovery procedures and regular testing
- **Network Security**: Properly configured firewalls, VPNs, and network isolation

### Operational Excellence

- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of system health and performance
- **Alerting**: 24/7 alerting system for critical issues
- **Automation**: Automated processes for routine tasks and potential failures
- **Documentation**: Well-documented operational procedures
- **Incident Response**: Clear incident response procedures and post-mortems

### Security Practices

- **Key Management**: Secure storage and handling of validator keys
- **HSM Usage**: Hardware Security Modules for key operations (recommended)
- **Access Control**: Strict access controls and principle of least privilege
- **Patching**: Regular and timely system patching
- **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews and penetration testing

## Operational Track Record

Validators should demonstrate a history of reliable operation:

### Performance Metrics

- **Uptime**: 99.5%+ uptime on previous networks or testnets
- **Block Production**: Consistent block production when scheduled
- **Responsiveness**: Quick response to network issues or upgrade requirements

### Network Participation

- **Testnet Involvement**: Active participation in Neutron testnets
- **Upgrade Support**: History of smooth handling of network upgrades
- **Crisis Management**: Demonstrated ability to respond effectively during network incidents

## Community Contribution

A strong Neutron validator contributes to the ecosystem beyond just running nodes:

### Development Contributions

- **Code Contributions**: Pull requests, bug fixes, or feature development
- **Technical Review**: Code review and technical feedback
- **Tool Development**: Development of tools or utilities beneficial to the ecosystem

### Documentation and Education

- **Documentation**: Contributing to technical documentation
- **Guides**: Creating guides or tutorials for users and other validators
- **Educational Content**: Producing educational content about Neutron

### Community Engagement

- **Forum Participation**: Active participation in governance discussions
- **Support**: Providing support to users and other validators
- **Events**: Organizing or speaking at community events
- **Outreach**: Helping grow the Neutron community

## Governance Participation

Validators are expected to actively participate in governance:

- **Voting**: Consistently voting on governance proposals
- **Proposal Creation**: Thoughtfully creating proposals when appropriate
- **Discussion**: Constructively contributing to governance discussions
- **Delegation Representation**: Effectively representing delegator interests

## Business Considerations

### Transparency

- **Commission Strategy**: Clear communication about commission rates and changes
- **Contact Information**: Publicly available contact information
- **Team Information**: Disclosure of team members and expertise
- **Operations Disclosure**: Transparency about infrastructure and security practices

### Long-term Commitment

- **Business Sustainability**: Demonstrated sustainable business model
- **Team Redundancy**: Multiple team members capable of managing validator operations
- **Long-term Vision**: Alignment with Neutron's long-term vision and roadmap

## Geographic Distribution

To enhance network resilience, validator geographic distribution is considered:

- **Jurisdictional Diversity**: Validators from different legal jurisdictions
- **Physical Distribution**: Physical location diversity to mitigate regional risks
- **Network Diversity**: Diverse network providers and data centers

## Application Process

Prospective validators must complete:

1. **Technical Application**: Detailed information about technical setup
2. **Team Background**: Information about the team and track record
3. **Contribution Plan**: Proposal for ecosystem contributions
4. **Community Review**: Period of community feedback
5. **Governance Approval**: Final governance vote for inclusion

## Ongoing Evaluation

Validators undergo continuous evaluation based on:

- **Performance Metrics**: Automated tracking of node performance
- **Contribution Tracking**: Documentation of ecosystem contributions
- **Community Feedback**: Input from community members
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic comprehensive evaluation

Meeting the initial selection criteria does not guarantee permanent validator status. Validators must maintain high standards and adapt to evolving requirements.
