# Validators Overview

Welcome to the Neutron validator documentation. This section provides all the information you need to become a validator, run a node, and participate in securing the Neutron network.

## What is a Validator?

Validators are responsible for committing new blocks to the blockchain through voting. A validator's stake is slashed if they become unavailable or sign blocks at the same height. Validators and their delegators earn NTRN as block rewards and transaction fees.

## Getting Started

To become a Neutron validator, you'll need to:

1. **Set up a node** - Configure and run a full Neutron node
2. **Create a validator** - Submit a transaction to register as a validator 
3. **Maintain your validator** - Keep your node secure and maintain high uptime
