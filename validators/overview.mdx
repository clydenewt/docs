Neutron validators secure the network by operating nodes that participate in consensus, validate transactions, and provide critical oracle data. Following the Mercury upgrade in April 2025, Neutron transitioned to a fully sovereign network with a unique validator model.

## Neutron's Validator Model

Neutron's validator model differs fundamentally from traditional Proof of Stake networks:

  <Card title="Fixed Supply" icon="coins">
    No inflation-based block rewards, preserving NTRN's fixed supply economics

  <Card title="DAO Treasury" icon="building-columns">
    All rewards paid directly from the DAO treasury instead of inflation

  <Card title="No Slashing" icon="shield-check">
    Uses jailing and rotation instead of traditional slashing mechanisms

    $3,000/month for validators meeting performance requirements

## Performance Requirements

Validators operate under strict performance criteria, with rewards tied directly to maintaining high-quality service:

| Performance Criterion | Minimum Threshold | Full Reward Threshold |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Block Signing         | 95%               | 99.5%                |
| Oracle Price Updates  | 95%               | 98%                  |

Validators who fail to meet minimum thresholds for two consecutive months or three months in a six-month period may be rotated out of the active set.

## Key Selection Criteria

    Validators must run both mainnet and testnet nodes

  <Card title="Technical Infrastructure" icon="server">
    High-quality hardware with redundancy and monitoring
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security Practices" icon="lock">
    Robust security measures including sentry nodes
  </Card>

## Mercury Upgrade

The Mercury upgrade in April 2025 marked a pivotal transition for Neutron, moving from Interchain Security (ICS) to a fully sovereign network. This enabled:

- Native NTRN staking with fixed supply tokenomics
- Performance improvements with reduced latency (~100ms) and increased throughput
- Better stability for the High Frequency Oracle and other infrastructure
- Faster upgrades and incident response capabilities
