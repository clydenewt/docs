Unlike generalized L1s that provide generic infrastructure, Neutron implements an integrated blockchain architecture focusing exclusively on DeFi by making highly-performant, application-specific infrastructure available to protocols within a shared execution environment.

## What is an Integrated Architecture?

An integrated architecture combines critical DeFi infrastructure directly at the protocol layer rather than as smart contracts or external services. This approach ensures guaranteed execution, native cross-chain communication, atomic composability, and predictable performance.

## Core Infrastructure Components

  <Card title="Oracle Module" icon="bolt" href="/developers/modules/oracle">
    Native price feeds updated every block with hardware-based security, eliminating dependence on external oracles and providing superior execution guarantees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interchain Queries (ICQ)" icon="network-wired" href="/developers/modules/interchain-queries">
    Direct state queries across any IBC-connected chain, enabling real-time cross-chain data access without trusted third parties.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cron Module" icon="clock" href="/developers/modules/cron">
    Native automation allowing scheduled and conditional contract execution with protocol-level reliability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interchain Accounts" icon="arrows-left-right" href="/developers/tutorials/cosmwasm_ica">
    Built-in interchain account functionality enabling seamless cross-chain operations with consensus-enforced security.

## Benefits of Integration

### 1. Capital Efficiency
- Optimized liquidity utilization across protocols
- Reduced capital requirements through composability

### 2. Reliability
- Infrastructure failures are consensus failures
- Guaranteed execution within block boundaries

### 3. Performance
- Direct state access without contract calls
- High-frequency oracle updates every block

### 4. Security
- Protocol-level validation of all operations
- No trusted external oracles or bridges

## Atomic Composability

Neutron's integrated architecture enables true atomic composability across all protocol features:

graph TD
    A[Smart Contract] -->|Atomic Transaction| B[Oracle Price]
    B --> C[Token Transfer]
    C --> D[Interchain Query]
    D --> E[Automated Execution]
```

All operations within a transaction either succeed together or fail together, with no partial execution states.

## Real-World Applications

### Supervaults
Supervaults represent a new approach to liquidity provision that overcomes the limitations of traditional AMMs. By leveraging Neutron's built-in high-frequency oracle and native automation features, Supervaults can:

- Market make at the most recent CEX prices
- Automatically rebalance every block
- Perform arbitrage themselves instead of being arbitraged
- Democratize profits to liquidity providers

### Cross-Chain Liquid Staking
Protocols can utilize Neutron's Interchain Accounts and Interchain Queries (ICQ) capabilities to:

- Read the state of other blockchains
- Adjust delegations made by remotely controlled accounts
- Onboard new assets from connected chains with a single transaction
- Provide users with a seamless cross-chain staking experience

<Note>
  Neutron's integrated architecture overcomes the limitations of both generalized L1s and app-specific chains by providing tailored DeFi infrastructure with atomic composability, creating a more capital-efficient, profitable, and convenient decentralized economy.
