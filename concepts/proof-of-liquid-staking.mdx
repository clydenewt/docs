Neutron's revolutionary staking model fundamentally reimagines the economics, incentives, and security model of Proof of Stake networks, creating a sustainable economic framework while encouraging active participation in DeFi.

## A Fixed Supply Token

At the heart of Neutron's staking model is the commitment to a fixed supply of NTRN tokens.

- **No Inflation**: NTRN maintains a fixed total supply, with block rewards set to zero. This creates a deflationary dynamic as tokens are placed into productive use.
- **DAO-Driven Rewards**: All staking rewards are paid directly from the Neutron DAO Treasury, rather than through new token issuance.
- **Revenue Capture**: Network fees and revenue accrue to the Neutron DAO Treasury, creating a sustainable mechanism for funding rewards.

This approach preserves the value of NTRN against dilution while still incentivizing network security through staking.

## Staking Economics

Neutron's staking model differs from traditional Proof of Stake in several important ways:

### Validator Compensation

Validators receive stable, predictable compensation based on their performance, regardless of market conditions:

- **Base Compensation**: Validators automatically receive monthly compensation from the Neutron DAO Treasury to cover operational costs and provide a reasonable margin.
- **Performance-Based**: Rewards are adjusted according to validators meeting specific thresholds for block signing and oracle price updates.
- **No Commissions**: Unlike traditional models, validators don't charge commissions on delegator rewards, creating a clearer separation of roles.

### Delegator Rewards

Users who stake NTRN tokens receive rewards that are:

- **Stable**: Target APR set by governance (initially 3%) provides predictable returns.
- **DAO-Funded**: Rewards come directly from the treasury rather than inflation.
- **Magnifiable**: Stakers can leverage their position through DeFi to potentially enhance returns.

### Enhanced Security Without Slashing

Neutron takes a different approach to network security:

- **No Slashing**: Delegators don't face the risk of having their staked assets reduced due to validator misbehavior.
- **Jailing and Tombstoning**: Validators who misbehave are removed from the active set without penalizing their delegators.
- **DAO Delegations**: The Neutron DAO stakes a significant portion of the treasury with validators to ensure a stable, secure network.

## Liquid Staking Integration

Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Neutron's model is the deep integration of liquid staking:

- **Native Support**: The network actively encourages the use of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like dNTRN.
- **DeFi Composability**: Staked NTRN can be represented as a liquid token and used throughout the ecosystem.
- **Enhanced Capital Efficiency**: Users can participate in network security while still utilizing their assets in DeFi.

The approach allows NTRN to remain productive even while securing the network, avoiding the capital inefficiency that plagues many Proof of Stake networks.

## Curated Validator Set

Neutron implements a focused approach to validation:

- **Specialized Role**: Validators focus on providing reliable, performant infrastructure rather than serving as governance representatives.
- **Clear Separation**: Delegating stake does not confer governance voting power to validators, creating a clear separation between network security and governance.
- **Performance Requirements**: Validators must maintain high standards for block signing (95%-99.5%) and price updates (95%-98%) to receive full rewards.

## Benefits Over Traditional Models

Neutron's Proof of Liquid Staking offers several advantages:

- **Sustainable Economics**: No inflation means token value isn't diluted to pay for security.
- **Predictable Rewards**: Both validators and delegators receive more stable, predictable compensation.
- **Reduced Delegation Risk**: No slashing protects delegators from validator misbehavior.
- **Capital Efficiency**: Liquid staking allows capital to simultaneously secure the network and participate in DeFi.
- **Aligned Incentives**: The DAO, validators, and users share aligned goals for network growth and sustainability.

## Implementation

The governance model is implemented through several mechanisms:

- **x/revenue Module**: Tracks validator performance and distributes rewards.
- **Staked NTRN Voting Vault**: Ensures native stakers can participate in governance.
- **DAO Treasury Management**: Strategic deployment of treasury assets to secure the network while fostering ecosystem growth.

This innovative approach to staking creates a more sustainable, efficient, and user-friendly network that aligns the interests of all participants while maintaining robust security.
