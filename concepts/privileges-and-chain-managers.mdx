title: "Privileges and Chain Managers"

Neutron's sophisticated governance architecture provides the flexibility and responsiveness needed for a high-performance financial blockchain while maintaining robust security and decentralization.

## Governance Architecture Overview

Unlike traditional Cosmos SDK chains that rely on a standard governance module, Neutron's governance is built on a customized fork of DAO DAO contracts. This creates a more flexible, modular governance system consisting of:

- **Neutron DAO (Main DAO)**: The primary governance entity with ultimate authority
- **SubDAOs**: Specialized governance entities with limited authority over specific domains
- **Chain Manager**: A contract managing privileged actions through permission strategies

This architecture allows Neutron to maintain decentralized control while enabling rapid response to urgent issues through delegated authority.

## Chain Manager

The Chain Manager is a critical component that mediates between governance and the blockchain's privileged functions. It implements a permission system to control which entities can execute which types of privileged actions.

### Permission Strategies

The Chain Manager uses two primary permission strategies:

1. **ALLOW_ALL**: Grants an entity full access to all privileged functions
2. **ALLOW_ONLY**: Permits an entity to execute only specific message types with possible additional restrictions

These strategies create a nuanced permission model where privileged functions can be delegated precisely according to need.

### Supported Privileged Messages

The Chain Manager supports various privileged message types:

| Message Type | Description | Possible Restrictions |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| `params.ParamChangeProposal` | Changes parameters of modules using the deprecated params module | Specific modules and parameters |
| `module_name.MsgUpdateParams` | Updates parameters of modules using the new-style param updates | Specific fields within the message |
| `cron.AddSchedule` | Adds new execution schedules to the CRON module | None |
| `cron.RemoveSchedule` | Removes schedules from the CRON module | None |
| `upgrade.SoftwareUpgradeProposal` | Schedules a software upgrade | None |
| `upgrade.CancelSoftwareUpgradeProposal` | Cancels a scheduled upgrade | None |

### Permission Assignments

Neutron assigns permissions to different entities:

- **Neutron DAO Core Contract**: ALLOW_ALL strategy, granting comprehensive control
- **Expedited Software Upgrades Multisig**: ALLOW_ONLY for software upgrade proposals and cancellations
- **Tokenfactory Hooks Multisig**: ALLOW_ONLY for updating tokenfactory hook parameters

This tiered approach enables emergency responses when needed while maintaining the DAO's ultimate authority.

## Neutron DAO

The Neutron DAO serves as the highest governance authority, with comprehensive control over the network, including the ability to grant and revoke permissions to subDAOs.

### Proposal Types

The Neutron DAO supports several proposal types:

- **Single-choice Proposals**: Standard yes/no decisions with a 50% threshold
- **Multiple-choice Proposals**: Decisions with multiple options where the most-voted option wins
- **Overrule Proposals**: Special proposals with a lower threshold (0.5%) for overruling subDAO decisions

### Voting Power

Neutron implements a sophisticated voting power system through its Voting Power Registry, which integrates multiple "Voting Vaults":

- **Real Vaults**: Allow users to directly bond and unbond NTRN tokens
- **Virtual Vaults**: Track NTRN held in other contracts (e.g., lockdrops, vesting contracts)

This ensures that all NTRN holders can participate in governance regardless of how their tokens are being used.

## SubDAOs

SubDAOs are specialized governance entities that handle specific domains, reducing the governance load on the main DAO and enabling more responsive decision-making.

### Timelocks & Overrules

A key innovation in Neutron's governance is the overrule mechanism:

1. When a subDAO proposal passes, it enters a timelock period (typically 3 days)
2. During this period, the main DAO can create an overrule proposal with a low threshold (0.5%)
3. If the overrule proposal passes, the subDAO proposal is rejected
4. If no overrule occurs, the subDAO proposal executes after the timelock period

This creates a balance between efficiency and accountability, allowing subDAOs to act independently while remaining subject to main DAO oversight.

### Security SubDAO

Neutron includes a specialized Security subDAO that can only execute `pause()` methods on certain contracts, enabling rapid response to security incidents. This subDAO can:

- Pause other subDAOs
- Pause the Reserve contract
- Pause the Distribution contract

## Benefits of Neutron's Governance Model

This sophisticated governance architecture provides several advantages:

- **Efficiency**: SubDAOs can handle routine matters without burdening the main DAO
- **Responsiveness**: Privileged entities can respond quickly to emergencies
- **Accountability**: The overrule mechanism ensures subDAOs remain accountable to the main DAO
- **Precision**: Permissions can be granted with fine-grained control over specific functions
- **Decentralization**: The main DAO retains ultimate authority over all aspects of the network

## Governance Parameters

Neutron's governance has carefully calibrated parameters:

### Main DAO Proposals
- **Deposit**: 1000 NTRN (refunded for passed proposals)
- **Voting Period**: 2 weeks
- **Quorum**: 5% of total voting power
- **Threshold**: 50% for single-choice proposals

### Overrule Proposals
- **Deposit**: None (as they're created automatically)
- **Voting Period**: 3 days
- **Threshold**: 0.5% of total voting power (absolute percentage type)
- **Revoting**: Disabled to enable immediate execution when threshold is met

These parameters balance thorough consideration of regular proposals with rapid response for overrules.

## Conclusion

Neutron's privileged actors and chain managers form a sophisticated governance system that balances efficiency, security, and decentralization. By combining a powerful main DAO with specialized subDAOs and nuanced permission controls, Neutron creates a governance architecture that can adapt to the demands of modern financial applications while maintaining robust security guarantees.
